# Javascript functions 
javascript function is a block of code that make specific task , its help for using that block of code more than once and make your code organized and more readable . 

funcion syntax : 
```
function its_name (arguments){
  block of code
}
```
as we can see to declare a function we should write `function` first then add thw name of it , then we pass somthing called argument you can think of them as a place holder or a value holder that holdes a value localy in the funcion 

> note : you can add global variables to your funcion also and then you dont need to put argument to add that variable when calling that funcion later .

after we declared the function we need to call that function to make it work 
```
its_name(variable,variable)

```

to recive or see or use the output values from the function we should write `return value` in the function

```
