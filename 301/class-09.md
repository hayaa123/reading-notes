# Functional Programming Concepts

## What is functional programming?

is the process of building software by composing pure functions, avoiding shared state, mutable data, and side-effects.

## What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?

is a function which:
Given the same inputs, always returns the same output, and
Has no side-effects

## What are the benefits of a pure function?

referential transparency

1-The function itself is easier to read.

2-The function will always be predictable and immutable.

3- Easier to debug and test the function.

## What is immutability?

is an object that can’t be modified after it’s created.

## What is Referential transparency?

you can replace a function call with its resulting value without changing the meaning of the program
