# nosql vs sql

## Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:

| SQL  |  NoSQL |
|---|---|
| called as Relational Databases   | non-relational or distributed database.  |
|  table based databases   | document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores  |
|  have predefined schema  | have dynamic schema for unstructured data  |
|uses SQL ( structured query language ) for defining and manipulating the data | queries are focused on collection of documents. Sometimes it is also called as UnQL (Unstructured Query Language)|
|vertically scalable |horizontally scalable |  

## What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?Give a real world example

SQL databases are good fit for the complex query intensive environment whereas

## What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?Give a real world example

NoSQL database fits better for the hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data.

## Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?

NoSQL

## Which type of database is best for scalability?

SQL --> for vertically scalable
NoSQL --> horizantaly scalable

## What does SQL stand for?

Structured Query Language

## What is a realational database?

a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another.

## What type of structure does a relational database work with?

logical data structures

## What is a ‘schema’?

refers to the organization of data as a blueprint of how the database is constructed [wiki](refers to the organization of data as a blueprint of how the database is constructed )

## What is a NoSQL database?

any non-relational database
