# JavaScript  operators
- Assignment operator : used to assign one value to a variable or variable to another 
```
it can be normal assignment --> x=1 
or can be additional ot substractonal --> x+=1 ,X-+ 1 which meant x=x+1 and x=x-1 
we can do multiplication division and even mod using this assinment operator  
```
but remember the program start to assign from right to left which means that `x=y=z` is the same as `y=z` then `x=y`

- comparasoin operator : used to compare tow values then return True or False 
```
== equal to  (compares the values not data type )
!= not equal 
=== strict equal (its compare the value and data type )
and there is > , < ,<=,>=
```
- arithmatic operators : used to make calculations 
```
+ , - , * , / 
 % -->mod  
 ** --> exponantiaion 
```

- logical opertor : returns True ot False 
```
%% --> and --> each operand should be true to get true value  
|| --> OR  --> one of the operand should be true to return true value
!  --> NOT --> If true returns false , if false return true
```
- string operators : used to concatenate to strings 
```
"hi" + "user"
```
 # loops 

 - for loop : used to repeat an action for specific number of time
 ```
 for (initial expersion , condition operator ,increment operator)
 {
   action
 }
 ```
 - while loop : used to repeate an action until its condition is satisfied
 ```
 while (condition)
 {
   action 
 }
 ``` 
 - do while loop : same as while but it is run once before checking the condition 
 {
   do{
   somthing 
   }
   while(condition);
 }
