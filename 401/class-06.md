# How to use Random Module

1. import the module `import random`

2. use the random methods

```

- random.randint(first value, last value) --> generate random integer between the first and last values

- random.random() --> generate a random number from 1 to 100

- random.choice( ['red', 'black', 'green'] ) --> generate a random value from a given sequence

- random.shuffle(list)  --> shuffle the list so its element become at random order 

- random.randrange(start, stop[, step]) --> Generate a randomly selected element from range(start, stop, step)

```

# What is Risk Analysis

>  is the process of identifying the risks in applications or software that you built and prioritizing them to test.

### Why use Risk Analysis?
 
 it helps the developers and managers to mitigate the risks

### Risk Identification

 - Business Risks: risk comes from your company 

 - Testing Risks:  comes from testing tools 

 - Premature Release Risk: releasing unsatisfactory or untested software

 - Software Risks: software development process.

### The perspective of Risk Assessment

- Effect

- Cause

- Likelihood

# Test Coverage

> I would say you are doing enough testing if the following is true: 1- You rarely get bugs that escape into production, 2 - and You are rarely hesitant to change some code for fear it will cause production bugs.
