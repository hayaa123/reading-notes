# hashtables 

Terminology:

1- **Hash** - A hash is the result of some algorithm taking an incoming string and converting it into a value that could be used for either security or some other purpose.

2- **Buckets** A bucket is what is contained in each index of the array of the hashtable.

3- **Collisions** - A collision is what happens when more than one key gets hashed to the same location of the hashtable.

# Why do we use them?

- Hold unique values

- Dictionary

- Library

# What Are they

- This means every Node or Bucket has both a key, and a value.

- hash is the ability to encode the key that will eventually map to a specific location in the data structure that we can look at directly to retrieve the value.

- we can do a lookup in an O(1) time complexity
