# Next JS 

## Dynamic Routes

-  we’ll create a page called [somthing].js under the desired route. Pages that begin with `[` and end with `]` are dynamic routes in Next.js.

- We’ll export an async function called getStaticPaths from this page.

- Finally, we need to implement getStaticProps again - this time, to fetch necessary data
