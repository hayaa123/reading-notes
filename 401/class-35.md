# Graphs

common terminology

1- Vertex - A vertex, also called a “node”, is a data object that can have zero or more adjacent vertices.

2- Edge - An edge is a connection between two nodes.

3- Neighbor - The neighbors of a node are its adjacent nodes, i.e., are connected via an edge.

4- Degree - The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to that vertex.


## Undirected Graphs

graph where each edge is undirected or bi-directional. This means that the undirected graph does not move in any direction

## Directed Graphs

called a Digraph is a graph where every edge is directed.

## Complete Graphs

A complete graph is when all nodes are connected to all other nodes.

## Connected

A connected graph is graph that has all of vertices/nodes have at least one edge

## Disconnected

A disconnected graph is a graph where some vertices may not have edges.

## Acyclic Graph

An acyclic graph is a directed graph without cycles.

A cycle is when a node can be traversed through and potentially end up back at itself.


## Cyclic Graphs

A Cyclic graph is a graph that has cycles.

A cycle is defined as a path of a positive length that starts and ends at the same vertex.
