# Intro to Django

## Getting started with Django

### Object-relational mapper

Deﬁne your data models entirely in Python. You get a rich, dynamic database-access API for free — but you can still write SQL if needed.

### URLs and views

To design URLs for an application, you create a Python module called a URLconf

### Templates

Django’s template language is designed to strike a balance between power and ease , its a template used for html 

### Forms

Django provides a way to generate forms from your existing models and use those forms to create and update data.

### Authentication

Django comes with a full-featured and secure authentication system. It handles user accounts, groups, permissions and cookie-based user sessions.

### Admin

One of the most powerful parts of Django is its automatic admin interface :D 

### Internationalization

Django offers full support for translating text into different languages, plus locale-specific formatting of dates, times, numbers, and time zones.

### Security

Django provides multiple protections against:

- Clickjacking

- Cross-site scripting

- Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

- SQL injection

- Remote code execution

## How Django Works Behind the Scenes

Django’s organization is managed by a non-profit, the DSF, with a miniscule budget. And Django code is lead by a core team of volunteers, two paid Django Fellows, and a larger group of contributors.
