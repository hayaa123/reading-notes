# Big O 

1) it represrnt the worset case effieiency 

2) used to evaluate --> time complexity and space complexity 

3) limiting factores used to calculate them 

    - input size

    - Unit of measurment 

    - worsed case , best case ,avarage case 

# linked list 

1)

> Linked List - A data structure that contains nodes that links/points to the next node in the list.

2)

> Node - Nodes are the individual items/links that live in a linked list. Each node contains the data for each list

![linked list ](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-05/resources/images/LinkedList1.PNG)

aswe can see in the image above each node reserve 2 spots in the memory the current value and the next value and then make the next value point to the next node :D

examples of this in python 

1) the include method 

2) add method

3) AddBefore


why linked list ? 

- its saves a space 

- its is a better way for adding and removing form the list

- make dealing with list smother
