# Beginners Guide to Big O

the big O notation shows us the maximum operation time or effecieny the code will give us 

O(1) --> this mean that the code will take the same time every run 

O(n) --> this means that the code time of execution will increase lineary with the data size (eg: loops )

O(n2) -- > this means that the code will take n*n time with the data increase (eg: loops of loops)

O(log n) --> this happens in binary search when we split the data to two halfs and repeat untel reach the target
