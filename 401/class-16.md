# Mashine Learning 

- Machine learning is a comprehensive approach to solving problems...

Key Terminology 

Model - a set of patterns learned from data.

Algorithm - a specific ML process used to train a model.

Training data - the dataset from which the algorithm learns the model.

Test data - a new dataset for reliably evaluating model performance.

Features - Variables (columns) in the dataset used to train the model.

Target variable - A specific variable you're trying to predict.

Observations - Data points (rows) in the dataset.

## Data Cleaning

- Remove Unwanted observations

- Fix Structural Errors

- Filter Unwanted Outliers

- Handle Missing Data

## Feature Engineering

Feature engineering is about creating new input features from your existing ones.

- Infuse Domain Knowledge 

- Create Interaction Features

- Combine Sparse Classes --> Sparse classes (in categorical features) are those that have very few total observations. They can be problematic for certain machine learning algorithms, causing models to be overfit.

- Add Dummy Variables --> are a set of binary (0 or 1) variables that each represent a single class from a categorical feature.

- Remove Unused Features

## Algorithm Selection

- Regularization  -->  is a technique used to prevent overfitting by artificially penalizing model coefficients.

- Regularized Regression Algos

    1- Lasso Regression

    2- Ridge Regression

    3- Elastic-Net

- Decision Tree Algos

    1- Bagging

    2- Boosting

    3- Random forests

    4- Boosted trees

## Model Training

    1- Split Dataset

    2- Fit and Tune Models

    3- Select Winning Model
